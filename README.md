# Manufacturing Quality Control Assistant üè≠

An end-to-end AI application that uses computer vision and generative AI to detect defects in manufactured parts and answer natural language questions about the production quality history.



## Overview

In manufacturing, ensuring product quality is critical. This project addresses this challenge by providing an intelligent system to automate and analyze the quality control process. It combines two powerful AI models into a single, user-friendly web application:

1.  A **Computer Vision Model** trained to instantly classify images of cast metal parts as either 'defective' or 'ok'.
2.  A **Generative AI Agent** (powered by Google Gemini) that connects to a production database, allowing users to ask complex questions in plain English and receive instant data-driven answers.

This project demonstrates a full-stack approach to building and deploying a practical, industry-relevant AI solution.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Real-time Defect Classification:** Upload a JPG, JPEG, or PNG image of a cast part for instant analysis.
* **Database Integration:** Every prediction is automatically logged in an SQLite database with a timestamp for historical analysis.
* **Natural Language Q&A:** Ask complex questions about the production history (e.g., "How many defects were found today?") and get answers generated by Google Gemini.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with a FastAPI backend for robust AI processing and a Streamlit frontend for a responsive user experience.

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Backend:** FastAPI, Python
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Computer Vision:** TensorFlow, Keras, Pillow
* **Generative AI:** Google Gemini, LangChain (SQL Agent)
* **Database:** SQLite, SQLAlchemy
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
